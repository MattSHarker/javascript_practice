# JavaScript Practice
A series of program to help teach myself javascript. The files will not run as they are, and are not intended to be ran as such, for they are formatted to demonstrate various aspects of JavaScript in a clearer manner.

The programs are created by following along with the book *Eloquent Javascript* by Marijn Haverbeke (3rd edition).

Each program was written in Visual Studio Code on Windows 10, and was tested in Chrome and the [sandbox provided by Haverbeke](https://eloquentjavascript.net/code/).
