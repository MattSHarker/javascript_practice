<!-- 
    Handlers registered on nodes with children will also
        receive events that happened on the children
    If both the parent and the child have a handler, the
        more specific button goes first
    Events are said to propagate OUTWARDS, starting from
        the original node, to its parents, to the root of
        the document

    At any point, an event handler can call stopPropagation,
        which prevents higher nodes from receiving the event 

    It is possible to use the "target" property to add handlers
        to multiple nodes at the same time
-->

<!-- Part 1
    This program registers a "mousedown" handler on both the
        paragraph and the button
    The button has a call to stopPropagation on right clicks,
        preventing the paragraph's event from running when
        the right mouse button is pressed

    Since two documents are being combined into one, the button
        will also register an event that gets attached in part 2
 -->

<!-- Part 2
    This document adds a handler to multiple buttons at the same time
