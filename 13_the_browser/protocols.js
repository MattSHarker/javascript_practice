// HTTP

// Hyper Text Transfer Protocol
// retrieves named sources (chunks of info)

// Treats networks like a stream-like device where you can add
    // bits and have them arrive at the desination in the right
    // order


// TCP

// Transmission Control Protocol
// One computer must be listening for other to talk to it
    // In order to listen to multiple things at the same time,
    // machines have different ports
// Another computer establishes a connection by using the correct
    // port number
// If the target machine is reached and is listening on the connected
    // port, a connection is created

// The listener is called the "server" and the connector is the "client"

// TCP is a two-way flow, both machines can send data


// THE WEB

// The World Wide Web (!=== the internet) is a set of protocols and formats
// "Web" is an allusion to a web, how things are interconnected to each other
// The port for the www is 80, and HTTP is used to connect to it


// URL

// Uniform Resource Locator
// URL example: https://github.com/MattSHarker

// The first part of the example (http://) shows the URL uses HTTP
    // as opposed to Secure HTTP (https://)

// The next part (github.com/) identifies which server we are sending
    // requests to

// The last part (MattSHarker) is the path that identifies which
    // specific resource is being accessed
