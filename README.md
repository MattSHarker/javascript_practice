# JavaScript Practice
A series of program to help teach myself javascript. 

The programs are created by following along with the book *Eloquent Javascript* by Marijn Haverbeke (3rd edition).

Each program was written in Visual Studio Code on Windows 10, and was tested in Chrome and the [sandbox provided by Haverbeke](https://eloquentjavascript.net/code/).
