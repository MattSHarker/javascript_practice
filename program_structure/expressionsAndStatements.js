// STATEMENTS
// most basic JS statement has a semicolon at the end of an expression
7;
!false;
4 * 37;

// semicolons can be omitted is certain scenarios, but it's safest to 
    // always include them


// BINDINGS
// aka variables
// a binding is an accessable piece of memory that stores information

// LET
// most basic version of creating a binding
let ten = 5 + 5;
ten = ten + 10;  // ten now stores 20

// defining multiple bindings in one statement
let one = 1, two = 2;


// VAR
// var (variable) works similarly to let, but has some different properties
var name = "Matthew"
// see ________ for more info


// CONST
// short for constant, the value in the binding cannot be changed once bound
const hw = "Hello World!";
