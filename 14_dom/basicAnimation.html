<!-- POSITION STYLE -->

<!--
the position style is set to "static" by default, meaning it does not move 
setting it to "relative" allows to set its "top" and "left" properties can 
    used to adjust its position relative to its original position 
"absolute" removes the element from normal document flow, and may overlap 
    with other elements 
    its top and left are now absolute position, relative to the top left 
        corner of the nearest element whose position isn't "static", or 
        the top left corner of the document if no other elements exist

<!--
the above document uses requestAnimationFrame to update the position of the
    image
updating the DOM in a loop would make the page freeze, as browsers do not 
    update while JS is actively running
requestAnimationFrame updates the browser at around 60fps (while the window 
    is active) 
I hate this style of comments
