// TYPES

// JS only consider's an object's type when running the program
    // JS will try to convert types as much as it can


// writing a comment before a function with input/output is helpful

// e.g.
// (VillageState, Array) -> {direction: string, memory: Array}
function goalOrientedRobot(state, memory) { /***/ }


// There are versions of JS that implement types, TypeScript being the most used
// https://www.typescriptlang.org/
